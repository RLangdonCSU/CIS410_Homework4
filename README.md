# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing the performance of students based on a dataset of their test scores, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion.

## Results

Here is a brief summary of the key results from the analysis:

1. **Basic Data Info**: We started by loading the dataset from a CSV file and displayed basic information about the dataset, including the first few rows and data types.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: We performed statistical analysis on math, reading, and writing scores, providing summary statistics to understand the distribution of scores.

3. **Group Analysis**: We grouped the data by race/ethnicity to calculate the mean scores for each group, providing insights into score variations among different ethnicities.

4. **Single Column Display**: We demonstrated how to display a single column (e.g., math scores) as both a DataFrame and a Series.

5. **Data Filtering**: We filtered the dataset to show only female students who scored 90 or higher in math.

6. **Data Visualization**: We used various data visualization techniques, such as box plots, bar plots, count plots, and scatter plots, to explore and visualize the data.

7. **Git Repository**: The repository includes a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Homework4.ipynb) to execute the code and explore the results.
